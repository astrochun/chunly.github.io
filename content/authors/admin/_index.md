Chun Ly is the Research Data Developer at
the [Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory](https://pppl.gov)
and an Affiliate Assistant Astronomer at
[Steward Observatory ](https://www.as.arizona.edu) at the University of
Arizona (UofA). He is responsible for developing an
[ORCiD](https://orcid.org) integration for the management of ORCiD
profiles  for PPPL researchers and for automating the dissemination of
open-access publications at a top-tier Department of Energy laboratory.

In his previous role at the UofA, he was the Research Data Systems
Integration Specialist where he built and maintained the
[UofA research data repository service (ReDATA)](https://arizona.figshare.com)
that enables open and reproducible science at the UofA.

He enjoys developing _open-source software_ with Python and spends his time
thinking about "DevOps" and how to implement it in reproducible research.

Chun earned his Bachelor's degrees in Astronomy and Physics from the UofA,
and received his Master's and Ph.D. from the
[University of Californiaâˆ’Los Angeles](http://www.ucla.edu/).
After completing his Ph.D., Chun held a Giacconi Postdoctoral Fellowship
position at the [Space Telescope Science Institute](https://www.stsci.edu)
(Baltimore, MD) and a NASA Postdoctoral Fellowship at the
[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard) (Greenbelt, MD).
He was a Queue Observer for the
[MMT Observatory](https://www.mmto.org) (Mt. Hopkins, AZ) between 2016 and 2019.
